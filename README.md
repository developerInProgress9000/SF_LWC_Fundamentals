# SF_LWC_Fundamentals
Salesforce Lightning Web Component fundamentals is a repo that holds examples of each fundamental skill that is involved with LWC development. There are a few projects and each one captures one or more of those particular skills. For example, one of the building block skills of LWC development is being able to communicate between components. So there is a project that demonstrates each type of communication, Child to Parent which communicate through Custom Events, Parent to Child, and Unrelated which communicate through the Lightning Messaging Service as Publishers and Subscribers.
